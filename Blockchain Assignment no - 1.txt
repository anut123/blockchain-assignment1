1. What is your understanding of Blockchain?
- Blockchain can be described as a data structure that holds transactional records
and while ensuring security, transparency, and decentralization. It as a chain or records
stored in the forms of blocks which are controlled by no single authority.

2. What is the core problem blockchain trying to solve?
- Authenticity and verifiable data that is decentralized which is transparent and
 less prone to hacking or tampering.

3. Features of Blockchain:
- Verifiable
- Unchangeable
- Tamper proof
- Immutable

4. What are the things that a Block will contain?
- Block number
- cryptographic hash of the previous block
- Transaction record or data
- Mining key

5. How the verifiability of Blockchain is attained?
- The data is distributed in various databases simultaneously and takes place every 
10 seconds. Each block contains new signature, data, cryptographic hash of the previous
 block. If the data is tampered at any point of time in a database or a system, the following 
blocks in that database or system will have different block hash than that of systems or 
databases that are un-tampered. At any point of time one can compare the block hash 
with other systems or databases to check if it is same.
